We've successfully implemented a comprehensive solution to handle multiple drops with the same passphrase in the same location, along with content safety features.

## Phase 2: Disambiguation UI ✅

   - Security tip reminder
   - Checkbox selection with "Unlock Selected" button

4. **Updated UnearthPopup**

   - Shows DisambiguationModal when needed
   - Handles drop selection workflow

### Example Scenario:
**Oasis Gig at Wembley - All using "oasis gig 2025"**

```
Found 3 drops with this passphrase. Select which one to unlock:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
