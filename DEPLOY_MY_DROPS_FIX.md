# üöÄ Quick Deploy Guide - My Drops Fix

## What Was Fixed
The "My Drops" page was showing fake test data instead of your actual drops from Firestore.

## Files Changed
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/user/drops/route.ts` - Now queries Firestore by ownerId
- ‚úÖ `src/app/app/drops/page.tsx` - Properly handles date serialization

## Deploy Now

```bash
cd C:\Claude\trove

# Check status
git status

# Add the fixed files
git add src/app/api/user/drops/route.ts src/app/app/drops/page.tsx

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: load user's actual drops from Firestore instead of mock data"

# Push (auto-deploys to Vercel)
git push origin main
```

‚è±Ô∏è Deployment takes ~2 minutes

## Test It

### Browser Test (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://trove-demo.vercel.app/app/drops
2. Login if needed
3. ‚úÖ Should see YOUR drops (or empty if none created)
4. ‚ùå Should NOT see "My First Drop" or "Photo Archive"

### Create a Drop Test
1. Create a new drop with title "Test My Drops Fix"
2. Go to My Drops page
3. ‚úÖ Should immediately see your new drop

### Multi-User Test
1. Create drop with Account A
2. Logout and create drop with Account B
3. ‚úÖ Each account only sees their own drops

## Before vs After

**Before (Mock Data):**
```
My Drops:
- My First Drop (fake)
- Photo Archive (fake)
```

**After (Real Data):**
```
My Drops:
- Happy Birthday! (your actual drop)
- Test My Drops Fix (your actual drop)
- [any other drops you created]
```

## Success = All These True
- [ ] My Drops shows actual drops you created
- [ ] Mock drops ("My First Drop", "Photo Archive") are gone
- [ ] Stats are accurate
- [ ] Can filter by public/private
- [ ] New drops appear immediately
