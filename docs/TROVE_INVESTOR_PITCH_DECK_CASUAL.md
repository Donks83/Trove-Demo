# TROVE 
## The Simple Pitch

**"Dropbox Meets Pokémon GO"**

---

# 📍 What Is Trove?

## Imagine This:

You're a construction foreman. You arrive at a job site. Your phone buzzes:

> **"New files available here: Updated_Site_Plans.pdf"**

One tap. Latest plans downloaded. You're working in 10 seconds.

**That's Trove.**

---

# 🎯 The Problem (In Plain English)

## Three Big Pain Points:

### 1. **"Where the hell is the latest blueprint?"**
- 47 emails with attachments
- 5 different versions
- Nobody knows which is current
- $50,000 rework because wrong version used

### 2. **"I'm at the site, but the files are... somewhere?"**
- 1,000+ files in Dropbox
- No idea which ones I need HERE
- Terrible cell signal
- Can't search folders on phone

### 3. **"Why is everything designed for office workers?"**
- 80% of workers don't sit at desks
- But 100% of file tools were built for desks
- Field workers are an afterthought
- They deserve better

---

# ✨ The Solution (Super Simple)

## How Trove Works:

```
📍 1. BURY FILES AT A LOCATION
    (Like planting a digital treasure)

🔐 2. LOCK WITH SECRET PHRASE
    (Only people with the password can open)

🎉 3. ANYONE THERE CAN UNLOCK
    (Show up at that spot, enter phrase, boom)
```

### Example:
**Old way:** Email blueprint to 50 people. Hope they download. Pray it's the right version.

**Trove way:** Bury blueprint at job site GPS coordinates. Anyone who shows up gets it automatically. Always the latest.

---

# 💰 The Opportunity (Big Numbers)
