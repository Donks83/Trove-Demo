## SLIDE 2: THE CONCEPT

# "Bury Files Anywhere. Unearth Them Everywhere."

## **Trove is Dropbox meets Pokémon GO**

We've created the world's first **location-based file sharing platform** that anchors digital content to physical GPS coordinates.

### The Magic Moment:
> "Walk to a construction site. Your phone automatically unlocks the blueprints for that exact location. No searching. No emails. Just there."

**Key Innovation:**  
Files aren't in folders. They're in *places*.

### Why It Matters:
- **$87 billion** spent annually on cloud storage
- **Zero** solutions designed for location-based work
- **2.5 billion** workers don't sit at desks
- **Physical space** is the last frontier for digital tools

**Tag Line:**  
*"Your Files, Right Where You Need Them"*

---

## SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM

# The Folder Model is Broken for Field Work

## **Three Critical Problems:**

### 🗂️ **Problem #1: The Email Attachment Death Spiral**
*"Where's the latest blueprint? Check email from Tuesday... no Wednesday... wait, was it the 9AM or 2PM version?"*

**Pain Points:**
- Construction foremen receive 47 emails/day with attachments
- 23% of time wasted finding current documents
- Version confusion causes costly mistakes
- 4.2 hours/week lost per worker searching for files

**Current Solution:** Email attachments, Dropbox links, USB drives  
**Reality:** Wrong versions, missed updates, safety risks

---

### 📍 **Problem #2: Location Context is Lost**
*"I'm at the hospital. Which building plan do I need?"*

**Pain Points:**
- Field workers have 1,000+ files in cloud storage
- No way to filter by location
- Must know exact folder structure
- WiFi often unavailable at remote sites

**Current Solution:** Manually organize into folders, hope for cellular service  
**Reality:** Workers arrive unprepared, delay projects, increase costs

---

### 🏗️ **Problem #3: The Deskless Worker Crisis**
80% of the global workforce doesn't sit at a desk, yet 100% of file-sharing tools were designed for office workers.

**The Numbers:**
- **2.7 billion** deskless workers globally
- **$1.2 trillion** lost annually to inefficiency
- **32%** of construction delays due to information access
- **87%** of field workers use personal devices

**Industries Suffering:**
- Construction ($12.6T global market)
- Real Estate ($3.7T)
- Emergency Services ($180B)
- Field Research ($90B)
- Event Management ($1.5T)

---

### ⚡ **Why Now: The Perfect Storm**

1. **Smartphone Saturation** - 6.8B smartphones globally (85% penetration)
2. **GPS Everywhere** - Precision down to 5 meters with modern devices
3. **Remote Work Boom** - 174% increase in field-based workforce
4. **Cloud Storage Plateau** - Dropbox/Box growing at only 12% (market mature)
5. **AR/VR Investment** - $10B+ in spatial computing proving location-based tech

**The Market is Ready. The Technology is Here. The Need is Urgent.**

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION

# Trove: Location-Intelligent File Management

## **How It Works:**

### The Trove Process (3 Steps)
```
1. BURY → Upload files at GPS coordinates
2. SECURE → Lock with passphrase + geofence radius
3. UNEARTH → Anyone at that location can unlock
```

### **Real-World Example:**

**Before Trove:** (Traditional)
1. Project manager emails 47 workers
2. Attachment: "Updated_Site_Plan_v12_FINAL_USE_THIS_ONE.pdf"
3. Worker arrives on site
4. Searches email on phone
5. Downloads wrong version (v11)
6. Builds to outdated specs
7. $50,000 rework needed

**With Trove:** (Location-Based)
1. PM uploads updated plan to site GPS coordinates
2. Worker arrives on site
3. Phone shows: "New files available here"
4. One tap: downloads current plan
5. Always has latest version
6. Zero mistakes

---

## **Core Innovation:**

### Traditional Cloud Storage:
```
Files → Folders → Search → Hope You Find It
```

### Trove:
```
Location → Files → Instant Access
```

### **Key Features:**

1. **Geofencing Technology**
   - Customizable radius (25m to 1km+)
   - GPS verification for sensitive files
   - Works offline with sync

2. **Smart Access Control**
   - Public: Anyone can discover and unlock
   - Private: Owner-only access
   - Shared: Team-based with passphrases
   - Treasure Hunts: Gamified discovery

3. **Physical vs. Remote Unlock**
   - Remote: Access from anywhere (like traditional cloud)
   - Physical: Must be on-site (GPS-validated)
   - Prevents document theft and ensures compliance

4. **Tiered Security**
   - Military-grade encryption (SHA-256)
   - Secret phrase protection
   - Owner verification
   - Audit trails

---

## **Unique Value Propositions:**

### For Workers:
✅ "Files just appear when I need them"  
✅ Zero search time  
✅ Always the latest version  
✅ Works on any device  

### For Managers:
✅ Ensure workers have current info  
✅ Track who accessed what and where  
✅ Update once, everyone sees it  
✅ Eliminate email attachment chaos  

### For Companies:
✅ Reduce errors by 67%  
✅ Save 4.2 hours/worker/week  
✅ Improve safety compliance  
✅ Measurable ROI in 30 days

## SLIDE 6: THE COMPETITION

# We Compete with Email Attachments (And We're Winning)

## **Competitive Landscape:**

### **Direct Competitors:** NONE
No other platform offers location-based business file sharing.

### **Indirect Competitors:**

| Competitor | Market Cap | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Dropbox** | $8.3B | Office-focused, no geolocation | We're mobile-first + location-native |
| **Box** | $4.2B | Enterprise complexity, no spatial features | Simple + location-intelligent |

| **Microsoft OneDrive** | (MSFT) | Tied to Office suite, desktop-centric | Standalone + mobile-first |
| **WeTransfer** | Private | One-time transfers only | Persistent location anchoring |

---

### **Substitute Competitors:**

**Email Attachments**
- ❌ Version chaos
- ❌ File size limits
- ❌ No location context
- ✅ **Trove eliminates email attachment pain**

**USB Drives**
- ❌ Lost/stolen
- ❌ Physical management
- ❌ No remote updates
- ✅ **Trove is digital + location-tied**

**Printed Documents**
- ❌ Expensive (15% of construction costs)
- ❌ Outdated instantly

---

## **Why This Budget Gets Us to Series A:**

### **Conservative Assumptions:**
- $2M gives us 18 months runway
- Need only $1.8M ARR to raise Series A
- That's 50,000 users @ 8% conversion
- **We'll be at $2-3M ARR** (overshoot target)

### **Milestones to Prove:**
1. ✅ Product-market fit (already showing)
2. ✅ Scalable customer acquisition ($12 CAC)
3. ✅ Enterprise viability (40 customers)
4. ✅ Unit economics work (50:1 LTV:CAC)
5. ✅ Team can execute (hire, ship, sell)

### **Series A Fundraising:**
- Raise $8-12M on $30-50M valuation
- Use to scale to $10M ARR
- Hire 20 AEs, expand international

---

## **Alternative Scenarios:**

### **If We Raise $1M Instead:**
- 12 months runway (vs. 18)
- Smaller team (skip some hires)
- Focus on B2C organic growth
- Still hit $1M ARR minimum for A
- Higher risk, but doable

### **If We Raise $3M Instead:**
- 24 months runway (vs. 18)
- Hire faster, move faster
- Likely hit $3-5M ARR
- Series A from position of strength
- Lower risk, better terms

### **If We Don't Need to Raise Series A:**
- Cash flow positive at Month 18
- Grow organically
- Raise Series A opportunistically
- Better valuation, more leverage
- **This is the goal**

---

## **Capital Efficiency Benchmarks:**

**vs. Comparable SaaS Startups:**

| Company | Seed Raised | ARR at A | Capital Efficiency |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Dropbox** | $1.2M | $2M | 1.7x |

| **DocuSign** | $5M | $8M | 1.6x |
| **Trove (Plan)** | $2M | $1.8M | **0.9x** |

- Sold personal assets to fund initial development

- Customers say "where have you been?"
