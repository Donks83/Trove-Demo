# ✅ Tier Radius Updates & Modal Sync Fix

## 📊 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Tier Radius Ranges

**New Ranges:**
- **Premium 👑:** 10m-500m (was 10m-100m) - **Full range access!**
- **Paid 💳:** 100m-500m (was 100m-300m)
- **Free 🆓:** 300m-500m (unchanged)

### 2. Fixed Create Drop Modal Sync Issue

**Problem:** The radius display in "Bury Files" modal didn't update when slider changed
**Solution:** Added useEffect to sync form value with selectedRadius prop

**Before:** Modal always showed 300m (default) regardless of slider
**After:** Modal dynamically updates to show exact radius from slider
