fix: pass authenticated app instance to getFirestore

Fixes Firestore READ operations that were failing with:
"16 UNAUTHENTICATED: Request had invalid authentication credentials"

## Problem
Firestore READ operations (GET, queries) were failing with authentication
errors while WRITE operations (POST) worked correctly. This caused:
- Drops to be saved successfully but become invisible
- Unearth operations to only find demo drops
- Persistence to appear broken after serverless restarts

## Root Cause
`getFirestore()` was called without passing the authenticated Firebase Admin
app instance, causing it to create a new, unauthenticated Firestore client.

## Solution
Pass the initialized and authenticated app instance explicitly:

```typescript
// Before (broken)
initAdmin()
const db = getFirestore()

// After (fixed)
const app = initAdmin()
const db = getFirestore(app)
```

## Impact
✅ All Firestore operations now use authenticated connection
✅ Drops persist correctly across serverless restarts
✅ Unearth operations can find Firestore-stored drops
✅ Geographic queries work as expected

## Testing
- Verified drops can be created and unearthed
- Tested persistence after serverless cold start
- Confirmed no UNAUTHENTICATED errors in logs
