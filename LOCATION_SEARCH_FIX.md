# üó∫Ô∏è Location Search Fix - Complete

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED AND READY TO TEST

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Issue:** Location search not recognizing postcodes, addresses, or named places

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Postcodes Not Recognized ‚ùå
**Before:** Searching for "TS1 3BA" returned no results  
**Cause:** `postcode` was missing from the geocoding types parameter

### Problem 2: Addresses Not Working Well ‚ùå
**Before:** Street addresses gave poor or no results  
**Cause:** Missing UK biasing and limited place types

### Problem 3: Named Places Not Working ‚ùå
**Before:** "Teesside University" didn't show up  
**Cause:** Missing `poi` (Points of Interest) type

### Problem 4: Search Didn't Navigate ‚ùå
**Before:** Clicking a result just logged to console  
**Cause:** No map navigation implementation

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Geocoding (`mapbox-geocoder.ts`)

**Added comprehensive location types:**
```typescript
types=country,region,postcode,district,place,locality,neighborhood,address,poi
```

Now searches for:
- ‚úÖ **Postcodes** (TS1 3BA, SW1A 1AA, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Addresses** (123 High Street, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **POIs** (Teesside University, Tesco, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Places** (London, Manchester, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Districts** (Westminster, Camden, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Neighborhoods** (Soho, Shoreditch, etc.)

**Added UK biasing:**
```typescript
country=GB  // Prioritize UK results
language=en // English results
autocomplete=true // Better search-as-you-type
```

**Enhanced result display:**
- Shows readable type badges (Postcode, Address, Place, etc.)
- Better name extraction
- Full place descriptions

---

### 2. Map Navigation (`map.tsx` & `map-view.tsx`)

**Added smooth map navigation:**
- Custom event system for location navigation
- Smooth flyTo animation (1.5 seconds)
- Zoom level 15 for selected locations
- Auto-set as drop location in bury mode

**How it works:**
```
User selects search result
    ‚Üì
Dispatch 'navigateToLocation' event
    ‚Üì
Map listens for event
    ‚Üì
Map.flyTo([lat, lng], zoom: 15)
    ‚Üì
Smooth animated transition ‚úÖ
```

---

### 3. Improved Search UI

**Visual enhancements:**
- üîµ Blue location pins (was gray)
- üìç Type badges (Postcode, Address, POI, etc.)
- Better hover effects
- Clearer result structure

**Example result display:**
```
üîµ Teesside University        [Place]
    University Boulevard, Middlesbrough, UK

üîµ TS1 3BA                     [Postcode]

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No results for postcode

**Check:**
1. Is postcode valid UK format?
2. Try with/without spaces (TS13BA vs TS1 3BA)
3. Check browser console for errors

**Verify Mapbox token:**
```javascript
console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN)
```

---

### Issue: Map doesn't navigate

**Check:**
1. Open browser console
2. Look for: "Map navigating to: ..."
3. Check if mapRef is defined

**Debug:**
```javascript
// In map-view.tsx
console.log('Search result clicked:', result)

// In map.tsx
console.log('Map ref:', mapRef.current)
```

---

### Issue: Wrong country results

**Verify UK biasing is working:**
```
Search: "Manchester"
Should prioritize: Manchester, UK
Not: Manchester, USA
```

If showing USA results, check geocoding URL includes `country=GB`.

---

## Performance

- **Limit:** 5 results max
- **Autocomplete:** Real-time as you type
