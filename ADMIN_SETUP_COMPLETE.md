# Admin Panel Setup - Complete âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… Added `isAdmin` to User Type
**File**: `src/types/index.ts`
- Added `isAdmin?: boolean` field to the User interface
- This enables admin status checking throughout the application

### 2. âœ… Updated Navigation Component
**File**: `src/components/navigation.tsx`
- Added Shield icon import
- Added "Admin" button in desktop navigation (visible only to admin users)
- Added "Admin Panel" option in user dropdown menu
- Added "Admin Panel" button in mobile navigation
- Added "Treasure Hunts" button to mobile navigation (was missing)
- Fixed missing HuntDashboardModal rendering

**New Admin Links:**
- **Desktop**: Blue "Admin" button next to Treasure Hunts button
- **Dropdown Menu**: "Admin Panel" option in user menu
- **Mobile**: "Admin Panel" button in mobile menu

### 3. âœ… Fixed Typo in Admin Users Page
**File**: `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Fixed `setFiltereredUsers` â†’ `setFilteredUsers` (line 49)
- This was causing a runtime error when searching users

### 4. âœ… Auth Provider Already Supports isAdmin
**File**: `src/components/auth-provider.tsx`
- No changes needed - already loads all user fields from Firestore
- The `isAdmin` field will automatically be included when present

   - Or browse the list to find your user document

4. **Add the isAdmin Field**
   - Click on your user document to open it
   - Click "Add field" (or the + button)

## What's Next?

### Priority 1: Test Everything
1. Make yourself admin in Firebase Console (see above)
2. Run through the testing checklist
3. Verify all features work end-to-end

### Priority 2: Email Verification System (REQUESTED)
Once admin panel is working, implement:
1. Send verification email on signup
2. Prevent unverified users from creating drops
3. Show verification status in profile
4. Resend verification email option
5. Verification badge in UI

### Priority 3: Complete Admin Panel (Optional)
- Analytics page - platform statistics
- Settings page - platform configuration
- Activity logs - track admin actions
- User activity tracking

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development server
cd C:\Claude\trove
npm run dev

# Visit the site
# http://localhost:3000

# Admin panel (after making yourself admin)
# http://localhost:3000/admin
```

---

## Important Notes

1. **Mobile App Unaffected**: The mobile app in `C:\Claude\Trove App` is separate and unchanged
2. **Double Security**: Admin status is checked both:
   - Frontend: Hide UI elements for non-admins
   - Backend: API routes validate admin status
3. **User Deletion**: Deletes user + all their drops + all their files
4. **Stats Placeholder**: Dashboard shows `--` for stats (connect to real data later)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Admin button doesn't appear"
- Ensure you added `isAdmin: true` to your user document in Firestore
- Sign out and sign in again
- Clear browser cache

### "Access Denied" on admin pages
- Check that `isAdmin: true` is set in Firestore
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### "Search users doesn't work"
- âœ… This is now fixed (typo was corrected)
- If still broken, check browser console for errors

### API errors
- Check that you're signed in
- Verify Firebase security rules allow admin operations
- Check browser console network tab for details
