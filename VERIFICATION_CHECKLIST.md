# ✅ Firestore Fix Verification Checklist

## Quick Start
The fix has been applied! Follow these steps to verify everything works.

---

## Step 1: Verify the Code Change ✅

**File:** `src/lib/firestore-drops.ts`

**Lines 4-5 should read:**
```typescript
const app = initAdmin()
const db = getFirestore(app) // Pass the app instance explicitly
```

✅ **Status:** Already applied!

---

## Step 2: Deploy to Production

### Option A: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
cd C:\Claude\trove

# Check current status
git status

# If firestore-drops.ts shows as modified, commit it
git add src/lib/firestore-drops.ts
git commit -m "fix: pass authenticated app instance to getFirestore"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy in ~2 minutes.

### Option B: Manual Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
cd C:\Claude\trove
vercel --prod
```

---

## Step 3: Test the Fix

### Quick Test (2 minutes)
```bash
# Run the automated test script
cd C:\Claude\trove
node scripts/test-firestore-persistence.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Success! Found X drops
✅ Found test drop: "Happy Birthday!"
✅ Success! Found drop: "Happy Birthday!"
🎉 All tests passed! Firestore persistence is working!
```

---

### Manual Web Test (3 minutes)

1. **Open:** https://trove-demo.vercel.app/unearth

2. **Enter test drop details:**
   - **Location:** Use the coordinates where "Happy Birthday!" was created
   - **Secret:** `Happy Birthday!`

3. **Click "Unearth"**

4. **Expected result:**
   ```
   ✅ Found "Happy Birthday!"!
   📦 X file(s) available for download
   ```

---

### API Test with cURL (1 minute)

```bash
curl -X POST https://trove-demo.vercel.app/api/drops/unearth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "coords": {
      "lat": YOUR_LAT_HERE,
      "lng": YOUR_LNG_HERE
    },
    "secret": "Happy Birthday!"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Happy Birthday!",
    ...
  }
}
```

---

## Step 4: Test End-to-End Persistence

### Create → Wait → Unearth Test

1. **Create a new drop:**
   - Go to: https://trove-demo.vercel.app/create
   - Upload a test file
   - Set title: "Test Persistence"
   - Set secret: "test123"
   - Note the coordinates
   - Submit

2. **Wait 10 minutes**
   - This lets the serverless function go cold
   - Tests true persistence (not just in-memory cache)

3. **Try to unearth:**
   - Go to: https://trove-demo.vercel.app/unearth
   - Use the same coordinates
   - Enter secret: "test123"
   - Click "Unearth"

4. **Expected result:**
   - ✅ Should successfully find the drop
   - ✅ Files should be downloadable
   - This proves Firestore persistence works!

---

## Step 5: Monitor Production Logs

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
vercel logs trove-demo --follow

# Or view in Vercel Dashboard
# https://vercel.com/your-team/trove-demo/logs
```

### Look for these success indicators:

✅ **On startup:**
```
✅ Firebase Admin initialized with service account
📦 Storage bucket: your-project.firebasestorage.app
```

✅ **When creating drops:**
```
✅ Uploaded file to Firebase Storage: filename.ext
✅ Drop saved to Firestore: drop_XXX
```

✅ **When unearthing drops:**
```
Found X Firestore drops nearby
🎉 Secret matches! Unlocking drop: [title]
```

❌ **Should NOT see:**
```
❌ 16 UNAUTHENTICATED: Request had invalid authentication credentials
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No drops found"

**Possible causes:**
1. Coordinates don't match (check Firestore console)
2. Outside geofence radius
3. Wrong secret phrase (case-sensitive!)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Firestore console
# Firebase Console > Firestore Database > drops collection
# Verify the drop exists and check its coordinates
```

---

### Issue: Still seeing UNAUTHENTICATED error

**Check:**
1. Environment variables are set in Vercel
2. FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY is valid JSON
3. Service account has correct permissions

**Verify env vars:**
```bash
vercel env ls
```

**Required variables:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
```

---

### Issue: Files won't download

**Check Storage Rules:**
```javascript
// storage.rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /drops/{dropId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix is working when:**

- [ ] Test script passes all tests
- [ ] Can unearth "Happy Birthday!" drop via web interface
- [ ] New drops persist after 10+ minute wait
- [ ] No UNAUTHENTICATED errors in logs
- [ ] `getDropsNearLocation()` returns Firestore drops
- [ ] Files download successfully from Firebase Storage

---

## What Changed?

### Before Fix
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong: Creates unauthenticated Firestore instance
initAdmin()
const db = getFirestore()
```

**Result:** Writes work ✅, Reads fail ❌

### After Fix  
```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Uses authenticated app instance
const app = initAdmin()
const db = getFirestore(app)
```

**Result:** Everything works ✅✅✅
